How to create your own c/cpp libraries in LINUX..........!
 - While making code for online coding contests, you might endup writting the same code again and againh.
 - Better way is to make the the recurring code as a library.
 - Ex. if you need linked-list data structure create library of basic actions performed on ll.
Simple steps to create library:
	1: Write recurring code in c/cpp file, make sure to add statis main function, so that it will not show any error while compilation.

	gcc -Wall -c <file>.c

	this will create <file>.o object file
	2: Add this obj file to /usr/lib/lib<file>.a
	3: Add this library to c/c++ code as, 
	
	gcc -l<file> <your_code>.c
